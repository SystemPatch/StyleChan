#### Install instructions

Installing [4chan X](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) is **REQUIRED** for StyleChan to work.

- In 4chan X **enable**: Quick Reply, Persistent QR and Auto Hide QR.

- Firefox: Requires the [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) addon.
- Chrom*: Requires the [Violentmonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag/) extension.

#### Troubleshooting

- If you have any problems, try first resetting 4chan X and StyleChan settings and then restarting your browser

- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, StyleChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality

- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/3nly/StyleChan/issues) page
